Documenting my path to becoming a cybersecurity professional
My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Started: January 5, 2025

## Goals
- Graduate with cybersecurity degree (Summer 2026)
- Land a cybersecurity internship
- Build practical skills in Linux, Python, and networking

## What I'm Learning
- Linux fundamentals
- Python programming
- Networking basics
- Security concepts

This repository will track my progress, projects, and learnings.

## Day 1 Progress - January 5, 2025
- Set up WSL2 and Ubuntu environment
- Practiced basic Linux commands: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, cat, echo
- Created my first bash scripts
- Learned file navigation and basic shell scripting

**Commands mastered today:**
- Navigation: pwd, ls, cd
- File operations: mkdir, touch, cat, echo, chmod
- Running scripts: bash scriptname.sh

## Day 2 Progress - January 6, 2025
- Reviewed Python fundamentals: variables, functions, loops, conditionals
- Built password strength checker script
- Created multiply function and loop practice scripts
- Wrote bash script to display system information
- Learned Git workflow: clone, add, commit, push
- Set up SSH authentication for GitHub
- Successfully pushed 4 scripts to repository from command line

**Key skills practiced:**
- Python: functions, if/else, string methods, user input
- Linux: file operations (cp, mv, rm), grep, wc, bash scripting
- Git: Full workflow from local development to GitHub

## Day 3 Progress - January 7, 2026
- Python deep dive: lists, dictionaries, file handling
- Built functional to-do list application with file persistence
- Linux: file permissions (chmod), process management (ps, top, kill)
- Created system monitoring bash script
- Learned Git merge conflict resolution

**Projects completed:**
- To-do list app (todo_app.py)
- System monitoring script (system_monitor.sh)

## Day 4 Progress - January 12, 2026
- Applied to 10+ cybersecurity internships (Indeed, LinkedIn)
- Built password cracker demonstration tool with two attack methods:
  - Dictionary attack using common weak passwords
  - Brute force attack for numeric passwords
  - Demonstrates password hashing (SHA-256) and security concepts

**Projects completed:**
- Password cracker tool (password_cracker.py)

**Skills practiced:**
- Python: hashing algorithms, time measurement, functions
- Security concepts: password cracking, brute force vs dictionary attacks
- Professional development: internship applications, self-improvement
